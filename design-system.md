giffgaff has product designers and developers spread over many cross-functional teams. I've built a Figma design library so that the giffgaff team of UX and UI designers can align on common visual standards and quickly put together designs for new screens and pages.

giffgaff is a company with many backend-focused 'fullstack developers'. I plugged the gap by building accessible UI components.
