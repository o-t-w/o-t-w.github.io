giffgaff has product designers and developers spread over many cross-functional teams. The design system enables UX and UI designers to align on common visual standards and quickly put together designs for new screens and pages. giffgaff is a company with many backend-focused 'fullstack developers'. I plugged the gap by building accessible UI components with HTML5,CSS and JavaScript.
