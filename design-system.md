giffgaff has product designers and developers spread out over many cross-functional teams. I've been working on a Figma design library so that the giffgaff team of UX and UI designers can align on common visual standards and quickly put together designs for new screens and pages.

The giffgaff design system consists of: 
    - A documented set of design principles
    - A Sketch library
    - A Storybook documentation site for React components.

giffgaff is a company with many backend-focused 'fullstack developers'.

At giffgaff we've been on a mission to improve accessibility across the website, and that's something I've focussed on in my design sytem work. 

To improve layout consistency and elimate duplicate code, I've established a grid system of reusable CSS classes.
