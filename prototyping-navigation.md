While Figma, Adobe XD and Axure all offer a measure of prototyping options, sometimes the best way to asses design directions is to write some code. 

I quickly prototyped rival design choices using HTML5, CSS and React.

Testing with real users is often ideal. In other situations quick feedback from those immediately available is an equally useful guage of success for a design. I user tested different iterations with people around the giffgaff office by asking them to navigate to a particular page of the website.
