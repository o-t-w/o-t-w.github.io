One key company-wide goal at giffgaff was improved SEO. For some marketing pages on giffgaff.com, the primary call to action was gaining shares on social media. To help achieve this goal I designed and coded reusable social share buttons. 

I've written up the considerations and thought process that went into designing and creating this component over at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/ux-considerations-for-web-sharing/">CSS Tricks</a>.
