The goal of this project was to bring the phone listing pages into line with the current giffgaff visual standards and to improve the visual hierarchy to make the page more easily scannable while also improving performance. 

Multiple ideas were explored in Figma. After multiple iterations and feedback from stakeholders, I prototyped the design in code to test it in a variety of screensizes and devices and with some mock JSON data to check that the design could hold up given a wide variety of real-world contexts and data variations.
