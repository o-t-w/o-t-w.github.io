<div class='readable-width'>

The goal of this project was to bring the phone range page into line with the current giffgaff visual standards and to improve the visual hierarchy to make the page more easily scannable while also improving performance. The design updated the page to make use of giffgaff's typography scale and brand colors and used SVG instead of pixelated icons.

Multiple ideas were explored in Figma. After several iterations and feedback from stakeholders, I prototyped further design ideas in code. This enabled testing at a wide variety of screensizes and devices. Using mock JSON data I was able to validate that the design could hold up given a wide variety of real-world contexts, image sizes and data variations.
