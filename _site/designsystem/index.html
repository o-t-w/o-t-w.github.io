<p>I've been working on a Figma design library so that the giffgaff team of UX and UI designers can align on common visual standards and quickly put together designs for new screens and pages.</p>
<p>giffgaff is a company with many backend-focused 'fullstack developers'.</p>
<p>Components I've coded at giffgaff include <a href="https://www.giffgaff.design/components/radio/">radio buttons</a>, <a href="https://www.giffgaff.design/components/chunky-buttons/">&quot;chunky buttons&quot;</a>, and <a href="https://www.giffgaff.design/components/masthead/">masthead</a>.</p>

<p>At giffgaff we've been on a mission to improve accessibility across the website, and that's something I've focussed on in my design sytem work.</p>
<p>To improve layout consistency and elimate duplicate code, I've established a grid system of reusable CSS classes.</p>
