giffgaff has product designers and developers spread out over many cross-functional teams. I've been working on a Figma design library so that the giffgaff team of UX and UI designers can align on common visual standards and quickly put together designs for new screens and pages.
<p>The giffgaff design system consists of:
- A documented set of design principles
- A Sketch library
- A Storybook documentation site for React components.</p>
<p>giffgaff is a company with many backend-focused 'fullstack developers'.</p>
<p>At giffgaff we've been on a mission to improve accessibility across the website, and that's something I've focussed on in my design sytem work.</p>
<p>To improve layout consistency and elimate duplicate code, I've established a grid system of reusable CSS classes.</p>
