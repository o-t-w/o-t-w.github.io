While Figma, Adobe XD and Axure all offer a measure of prototyping options, sometimes the best way to asses design directions is to write some code. 
<p>I quickly prototyped rival design choices using HTML5, CSS and React.</p>
<p>Testing with real users is often ideal. In other situations quick feedback from those immediately available is an equally useful guage of success for a design. I user tested different iterations with people around the giffgaff office by asking them to navigate to a particular page of the website.</p>
